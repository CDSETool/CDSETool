Additionally, precise measurements of spacecraft position and attitude are available for every observation [https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-1].","organisationName":null,"startDate":"2014-06-05T22:59:44.000Z","completionDate":"2014-06-07T00:59:44.000Z","productType":"AUX_POEORB","processingLevel":null,"platform":"SENTINEL-1","instrument":"SAR","resolution":0,"sensorMode":null,"orbitNumber":0,"quicklook":null,"thumbnail":null,"updated":"2023-10-25T18:01:11.578Z","published":"2023-10-25T16:28:33.454Z","snowCover":0,"cloudCover":0,"gmlgeometry":null,"centroid":{"type":null,"coordinates":null},"orbitDirection":null,"timeliness":null,"relativeOrbitNumber":0,"processingBaseline":0,"polarisation":null,"swath":null,"services":{"download":{"url":"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/download/3435e8d4-00a6-498e-9ba0-6a1e79d5408f","mimeType":"application/octet-stream","size":4413219}},"links":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/json","title":"GeoJSON link for 3435e8d4-00a6-498e-9ba0-6a1e79d5408f","href":"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/collections/SENTINEL-1/3435e8d4-00a6-498e-9ba0-6a1e79d5408f.json"}]}}]}
