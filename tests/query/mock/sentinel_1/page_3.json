Additionally, precise measurements of spacecraft position and attitude are available for every observation [https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-1].","organisationName":null,"startDate":"2014-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","completionDate":"2014-06-09T23:59:59.000Z","productType":"AUX_PROQUA","processingLevel":null,"platform":"SENTINEL-1","instrument":"SAR","resolution":0,"sensorMode":null,"orbitNumber":0,"quicklook":null,"thumbnail":null,"updated":"2023-11-14T22:51:04.210Z","published":"2023-10-25T16:06:33.054Z","snowCover":0,"cloudCover":0,"gmlgeometry":null,"centroid":{"type":null,"coordinates":null},"orbitDirection":null,"timeliness":null,"relativeOrbitNumber":0,"processingBaseline":0,"polarisation":null,"swath":null,"services":{"download":{"url":"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/download/eea5a489-4283-4f08-842e-d1cb8d84bed5","mimeType":"application/octet-stream","size":1545639}},"links":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/json","title":"GeoJSON link for eea5a489-4283-4f08-842e-d1cb8d84bed5","href":"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/collections/SENTINEL-1/eea5a489-4283-4f08-842e-d1cb8d84bed5.json"}]}}]}
