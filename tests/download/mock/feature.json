The Sentinel-1 mission includes C-band imaging operating in four exclusive imaging modes with different resolution (down to 5 m) and coverage (up to 400 km). It provides dual polarization capability, short revisit times and rapid product delivery. Additionally, precise measurements of spacecraft position and attitude are available for every observation [https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-1].","organisationName":null,"startDate":"2014-06-29T00:00:05.000Z","completionDate":"2014-06-29T23:59:55.000Z","productType":"AUX_GNSSRD","processingLevel":null,"platform":"SENTINEL-1","instrument":"SAR","resolution":0,"sensorMode":null,"orbitNumber":0,"quicklook":null,"thumbnail":null,"updated":"2023-11-14T23:02:25.755Z","published":"2023-10-25T09:24:50.660Z","snowCover":0,"cloudCover":0,"gmlgeometry":null,"centroid":{"type":null,"coordinates":null},"orbitDirection":null,"timeliness":null,"relativeOrbitNumber":0,"processingBaseline":0,"polarisation":null,"swath":null,"services":{"download":{"url":"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/download/171fd093-b1bc-4528-910b-73156cd0b5d3","mimeType":"application/octet-stream","size":2655944}},"links":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/json","title":"GeoJSON link for 171fd093-b1bc-4528-910b-73156cd0b5d3","href":"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/collections/SENTINEL-1/171fd093-b1bc-4528-910b-73156cd0b5d3.json"}]}}
